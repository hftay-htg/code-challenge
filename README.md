# Code Challenges

The following code challenges are an opportunity to demostrate proficiency in the problem solving skills we expect you to have at HT Group.

## Expectations
Create a new git repository for the challenges. Organize your code within that repo. When you get to a stopping point, commit and push your code and email a link to your repo to <hsingfu.tay@htgroup.com.my>
 
You should ideally complete the challenges in Ruby, however, we accept solutions in Javascript and PHP too.

## Time Estimate
The challenges are scoped for 1-hour timeframe. We respect your time and don't want you spending more than the alloted time. We just want to get a sense of your thought process and problem solving skills. If there are features you don't have time to implement, feel free to use pseudo code to describe the intended behavior.

## Your Challenge README
Include the following items in your README:

* Description of the problem and solution.
* Reasoning behind your solution. Include any trade-offs you might have made, anything you left out, or what you might do differently if you were to spend additional time on the problem.
* Link to to the hosted application where applicable.

## What We Review
The aspects of your code we will review include:

* Clarity: Does the README clearly explain the problem and solution?
* Correctness: Does the solution fulfil what was asked? If there is anything missing, does the README explain why it is missing?
* Code Quality: Is the code simple, easy to understand, and maintainable?
